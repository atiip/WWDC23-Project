# WWDC23-Project
The application developed is an application based on drag and drop games which is useful for helping users to be able to mix and match the clothes they have, but for now, due to the limited file size that needs to be collected, this application can only mix and match clothes that are available in app assets only. I also developed this application taking into account my habit of not being confident when the clothes I wear don't suit me. So enjoy and have fun :)

For assets: 
I only use assets that have been proven to be free licenses and can be used for commercial or personal use. Here I attach links to the resource assets that I use:
